antispam
========

This library currently provides only very simple means to filter spam messages. It was broken out to a separate project so that it can be shared between the [vibenews](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/vibenews) and the [vibelog](https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/vibelog) projects.
